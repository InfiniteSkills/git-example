If you'd like to experiment a bit with public pull requests, try this out:

1)  Fork the entire project.
2)  Add your name (or GitHub user account) to this file.
My GitHub user account: shflorez
3)  Submit a pull request to have your name / account added to the 'master' project.

It will also be a way that you can start a conversation with me if you'd like.  I'd love to know if you find the course useful.
